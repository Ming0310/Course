LUKE	Echo Three to Echo Seven . Han , old buddy , do you   read me ?
HAN	Loud and clear , kid . What 's up ?
LUKE	Well , I finished my circle . I do n't pick up any   life readings .
HAN	There is n't enough life on this ice cube to fill a   space cruiser . The sensors are placed . I 'm going back .
LUKE	Right . I 'll see you shortly . There 's a meteorite   that hit the ground near here . I want to check it out . It wo n't take long .
LUKE	Hey , steady girl . What 's the matter ? You smell something ?
LUKE	Aaargh !
HAN	Chewie !
HAN	All right , do n't lose your temper . I 'll come right back and give   you a hand .
RIEEKAN	Solo ?
HAN	No sign of life out there , General . The sensors are in place .   You 'll know if anything comes around .
RIEEKAN	Commander Skywalker reported in yet ?
HAN	No . He 's checking out a meteorite that hit near him .
RIEEKAN	With all the meteor activity in this   system , it 's going to be difficult to spot approaching ships .
HAN	General , I 've got to leave . I ca n't stay anymore .
RIEEKAN	I 'm sorry to hear that .
HAN	Well , there 's a price on my head . If I do n't pay off Jabba the   Hut , I 'm a dead man .
RIEEKAN	A death mark 's not an easy thing to live with . You 're a good   fighter , Solo . I hate to lose you .
HAN	Thank you , General .
HAN	Well , Your Highness , I guess this is it .
LEIA	That 's right .
HAN	Well , do n't get all mushy on me . So long , Princess .
LEIA	Han !
HAN	Yes , Your Highnessness ?
LEIA	I thought you decided to stay .
HAN	Well , the bounty hunter we ran into on Ord Mantell changed my   mind .
LEIA	Han , we need you !
HAN	We ?
LEIA	Yes .
HAN	Oh , what about you need ?
LEIA	I need ? I do n't know what you 're talking about .
HAN	You probably do n't .
LEIA	And what precisely am I supposed to know ?
HAN	Come on ! You want me to stay because of the way you feel about   me .
LEIA	Yes . You 're a great help to us . You 're a natural leader ...
HAN	No ! That 's not it . Come on . Aahhh -- uh huh ! Come on .
LEIA	You 're imagining things .
HAN	Am I ? Then why are you following me ? Afraid I was going to leave   without giving you a goodbye kiss ?
LEIA	I 'd just as soon kiss a Wookiee .
HAN	I can arrange that . You could use a good kiss !
THREEPIO	Do n't try to blame me . I did n't ask you to turn on the   thermal heater . I merely commented that it was freezing in the princess 's chamber . But it 's supposed to be freezing . How are we going to dry out all her clothes ? I really do n't know .
THREEPIO	Oh , switch off .
HAN	Why do you take this apart now ? I 'm trying to get us   out of here and you pull both of these .
THREEPIO	Excuse me , sir .
HAN	Put them back together right now .
THREEPIO	Might I have a word with you , please ?
HAN	What do you want ?
THREEPIO	Well , it 's Princess Leia , sir . She 's been trying to get you   on the communicator .
HAN	I turned it off . I do n't want to talk to her .
THREEPIO	Oh . Well , Princess Leia is wondering about Master Luke . He   has n't come back yet . She does n't know where he is .
HAN	I do n't know where he is .
THREEPIO	Nobody knows where he is .
HAN	What do you mean , \"nobody knows\ " ?
THREEPIO	Well , uh , you see ...
HAN	Deck Officer . Deck Officer !
THREEPIO	Excuse me , sir . Might I inqu- ...
DECK OFFICER	Yes , sir ?
HAN	Do you know where Commander Skywalker is ?
DECK OFFICER	I have n't seen him . It 's possible he came in through the   south entrance .
HAN	It 's possible ? Why do n't you go find out ? It 's getting dark out   there .
DECK OFFICER	Yes , sir .
THREEPIO	Excuse me , sir . Might I inquire what 's going on ?
HAN	Why not ?
THREEPIO	Impossible man . Come along , Artoo , lets find Princess Leia .   Between ourselves , I think Master Luke is in considerable danger .
DECK OFFICER	Sir , Commander Skywalker has n't come in through the   south entrance . He might have forgotten to check in .
HAN	Not likely . Are the speeders ready ?
DECK OFFICER	Not yet . We 're having some trouble adapting them to the   cold .
HAN	Then we 'll have to go out on Tauntauns .
DECK OFFICER	Sir , the temperature 's dropping too rapidly .
HAN	That 's right . And my friends out in it .
ASSISTANT OFFICER	I 'll cover sector twelve . Have com - control set   screen alpha .
DECK OFFICER	Your Tauntaun'll freeze before you reach the first   marker .
HAN	Then I 'll see you in hell !
THREEPIO	You must come along now , Artoo . There 's really nothing more   we can do . And my joints are freezing up .
THREEPIO	Do n't say thing like that ! Of course we 'll see Master Luke   again . He 'll be quite all right , you 'll see .   Stupid little short - circuit . He 'll be quite all right .
LIEUTENANT	Sir , all the patrols are in . There 's still no contact from   Skywalker or Solo .
THREEPIO	Mistress Leia , Artoo says he 's been quite unable to pick up   any signals , although he does admit that his own range is far too weak to abandon all hope .
DERLIN	Your Highness , there 's nothing more we can do tonight . The   shield doors must be closed .
DERLIN	Close the doors .
LIEUTENANT	Yes , sir .
THREEPIO	Artoo says the chances of survival are seven hundred   seventy - five ... to one .
THREEPIO	Actually , Artoo has been known to make mistakes ... from time   to time . Oh , dear , oh , dear . Do n't worry about Master Luke . I 'm sure he 'll be all right . He 's quite clever , you know ... for a human being .
BEN	Luke ... Luke .
LUKE	Ben ?
BEN	You will go to the Dagobah system .
LUKE	Dagobah system ?
BEN	There you will learn from Yoda , the Jedi Master who instructed   me .
LUKE	Ben ... Ben .
HAN	Luke ! Luke ! Do n't do this , Luke . Come on , give me a sign here .
HAN	Not much time .
LUKE	Ben ... Ben ...
HAN	Hang on , kid .
LUKE	Dagobah system ...
HAN	Whew ...
LUKE	Dagobah ...
HAN	This may smell bad , kid ...
LUKE	Yoda ...
HAN	... but it will keep you warm ... til I get the shelter built .    Ooh ... I thought they smelled bad on the outside !
ZEV	Echo Base ... I've got something ! Not much , but   it could be a life form .
ZEV	This is Rouge Two . this is Rouge Two . Captain   Solo , so you copy ? Commander Skywalker , do you copy ? This is Rouge Two .
HAN	Good morning . Nice of you guys to   drop by .
ZEV	Echo Base ... this is Rouge Two . I found   them . Repeat , I found them .
THREEPIO	Master Luke , sir , it 's good to see you fully functional   again .
THREEPIO	Artoo expresses his relief , also .
HAN	How are you feeling , kid ? You do n't look so bad to me . In fact ,   you look strong enough to pull the ears off a Gundark .
LUKE	Thanks to you .
HAN	That 's two you owe me , junior .
HAN	Well your Worship , looks like you managed to keep me around for a   little while longer .
LEIA	I had nothing to do with it . General Rieekan thinks   it 's dangerous for any ships to leave the system until we 've activated the energy shield .
HAN	That 's a good story . I think you just ca n't bear to let a   gorgeous guy like me out of your sight .
LEIA	I do n't know where you get you delusions , laser brain .
HAN	Laugh it up , fuzz ball . But you did n't see us alone in the south   passage .
HAN	She expressed her true feelings for me .
LEIA	My ... ! Why , you stuck up, ... half - witted, ... scruffy - looking ...   nerf - herder !
HAN	Who 's scruffy - looking ?   I must have hit her pretty close   to the mark to get her all riled up like that , huh , kid ?
LEIA	Why , I guess you do n't know everything about women yet ?
ANNOUNCER	Headquarters personnel , report to command   center .
HAN	Take it easy .
THREEPIO	Excuse us , please .
RIEEKAN	Princess ... we have a visitor .
RIEEKAN	We 've picked up something outside the base in zone twelve ,   moving east .
SENIOR CONTROLLER	It 's metal .
LEIA	Then it could n't be one of those creatures that attacked Luke .
HAN	It could be a speeder , one of ours .
SENIOR CONTROLLER	No . Wait -- there 's something very weak coming   through .
THREEPIO	Sir , I am fluent in six million forms of communication . This   signal is not used by the Alliance . It could be an Imperial code .
HAN	It is n't friendly , whatever it is . Come on , Chewie , let 's check   it out .
RIEEKAN	Send Rouges Ten and Eleven to station three - eight .
HAN	Afraid there 's not much left .
LEIA	What was it ?
HAN	Droid of some kind . I did n't hit it that hard . It   must have had a self - destruct .
LEIA	An Imperial probe droid .
HAN	It 's a good bet the Empire knows we 're here .
RIEEKAN	We 'd better start the evacuation .
PIETT	Admiral .
OZZEL	Yes , Captain
PIETT	I think we 've got something , sir . The report is only a fragment   had .
OZZEL	We have thousands of probe droids searching the   galaxy . I want proof , not leads !
PIETT	The visuals indicate life readings .
OZZEL	It could mean anything . If we followed every lead ...
PIETT	But , sir , the Hoth system is supposed to be devoid of human   forms .
VADER	You found something ?
PIETT	Yes , my lord .
VADER	That 's it . The   Rebels are there .
OZZEL	My lord , there are so many uncharted settlements . It could be   smugglers , it could be ...
VADER	That is the system . And I 'm sure Skywalker is with them . Set   your course for the Hoth system . General Veers , prepare you men .
REBEL CAPTAIN	Groups seven and ten will stay behind to fly the   speeders . As soon as each transport is loaded , evacuation control will give clearance for immediate launch .
REBEL FIGHTER	Right , sir .
HAN	Okay , that 's it . Try it ... Off ! Turn it   off ! Turn it off ! Off !
MEDICAL DROID	Sir , it will take quite awhile to evacuate the T - forty-   sevens .
LUKE	Well , forget the heavy equipment . There 's plenty of time to get   the smaller modules on the transports .
MEDICAL DROID	Take care , sir .
LUKE	Thanks .
LUKE	Chewie , take care of yourself , okay ?
HAN	Hi , kid .   There 's got to be a reason for it . Check it   at the other end . Wait a second .   You all right ?
LUKE	Yeah .
HAN	Be careful .
LUKE	You , too .
CONTROLLER	General , there 's a fleet of Star Destroyers coming out of   hyperspace in sector four .
RIEEKAN	Reroute all power to the energy shield . We 've got to hold   them till all transports are away . Prepare for ground assault .
VADER	What is it , General ?
VEERS	My lord , the fleet has moves out of light - speed . Com - Scan has   detected an energy field protecting an area around the sixth planet of the Hoth system . The field is strong enough to deflect any bombardment .
VADER	The Rebels are alerted to our presence . Admiral Ozzel   came out of light - speed too close to the system .
VEERS	He felt surprise was wiser ...
VADER	He is as clumsy as he is stupid . General , prepare your troops   for a surface attack .
VEERS	Yes , my lord .
OZZEL	Lord Vader , the fleet has moved out of light - speed , and we 're   preparing to ... Aaagh !
VADER	You have failed me for the last time , Admiral . Captain Piett .
PIETT	Yes , my lord .
VADER	Make ready to land out troops beyond the energy shield and   deploy the fleet so that nothing gets off that system . You are in command now , Admiral Piett .
PIETT	Thank you , Lord Vader .
LEIA	All troop carriers will assemble at the north entrance . The   heavy transport ships will leave as soon as they 're loaded . Only two fighter escorts per ship . The energy shield can only be opened for a short time , so you 'll have to stay very close to your transports .
HOBBIE	Two fighters against a Star Destroyer ?
LEIA	The ion cannon will fire several shots to make sure that any   enemy ships will be out of your flight path . When you 've gotten past the energy shield , proceed directly to the rendezvous point . Understood ?
PILOTS	Right . Okay .
LEIA	Good luck .
DERLIN	Okay . Everyone to your stations . Let 's go !
RIEEKAN	Their primary target will be the power generators . Prepare to   open the shield .
CONTROLLER	Sir , Rebel ships are coming into our sector .
CAPTAIN	Good . Our first catch of the day .
WOMAN CONTROLLER	Stand by , ion control .... Fire !
ANNOUNCER	The first transport is away .
DACK	Feeling all right , sir ?
LUKE	Just like new , Dack . How about you ?
DACK	Right now I feel I could take on the whole Empire myself .
LUKE	I know what you mean .
TRENCH OFFICER	Echo Station Three - T - Eight .
TRENCH OFFICER	We have spotted Imperial walkers !
CONTROLLER	Imperial walkers on the north ridge .
LUKE	Echo station Five - Seven . We 're on our way .
LUKE	All right , boys , keep tight now .
DACK	Luke , I have no approach vector . I 'm not set .
LUKE	Steady , Dack . Attack pattern delta . Go now !
LUKE	All right , I 'm coming in .
LUKE	Hobbie , you still with me ?
LUKE	That armor 's too strong for blasters .
LUKE	Rouge Group , use your harpoons and tow cables . Go   for the legs . It might be our only chance of stopping them .   All right , stand by , Dack .
DACK	Luke , we 've got a malfunction in fire control . I 'll have to cut   in the auxiliary .
LUKE	Just hang on . Hang on , Dack . Get ready to fire that tow cable .
LUKE	Dack ? Dack !
VEERS	Yes , Lord Vader . I 've reached the main power generator . The   shield will be down in moments . You may start your landing .
LUKE	Rouge Three .
WEDGE	Copy , Rouge Leader
LUKE	Wedge , I 've lost my gunner . You 'll have to make   this shot . I 'll cover for you . Set your harpoon . Follow me on the next pass .
WEDGE	Coming around , Rouge Leader .
LUKE	Steady , Rouge Two
WEDGE	Activate harpoon .
WEDGE	Good shot , Janson .
WEDGE	One more pass .
JANSON	Coming around . Once more .
JANSON	One more .
JANSON	Cable out ! Let her go !
WEDGE	Detach cable .
JANSON	Cable detached .
TRENCH OFFICER	Come on !
WEDGE	Whooha ! ! That got him !
LUKE	I see it , Wedge . Good work .
RIEEKAN	I do n't think we can protect two transports at a time .
LEIA	It 's risky , but we ca n't hold out much longer . We have no   choice .
RIEEKAN	Launch patrols .
LEIA	Evacuate remaining ground staff .
HAN	No , no ! No ! This one goes there , that one goes there . right ?
THREEPIO	Artoo , you take good care of Master Luke now , understand ?   And ... do take care of yourself . Oh , dear , oh , dear .
VEERS	All troops will debark for ground assault . Prepare to target   the main generator .
LUKE	Rouge Two , are you all right ?
ZEV	Yeah . I 'm with you , Rouge Leader .
LUKE	We 'll set harpoon . I 'll cover for you .
ZEV	Coming around .
LUKE	Watch that cross fire , boys .
ZEV	Set for position three .   Steady .
LUKE	Stay tight and low .
LUKE	Hobbie , I 've been hit !
HAN	You all right ?
LEIA	Why are you still here ?
HAN	I heard the command center had been hit .
LEIA	You got your clearance to leave .
HAN	Do n't worry . I 'll leave . First I 'm going to get you to your ship .
THREEPIO	Your Highness , we must take this last transport . It 's our   only hope .
LEIA	Send all troops in sector twelve to the south   slope to protect the fighters .
ANNOUNCER	Imperial troops have entered the base .
HAN	Come on ... that 's it .
LEIA	Give the evacuation code signal . And get to   your transports !
HEAD CONTROLLER	K - one - zero ... all troops disengage .
THREEPIO	Oh ! Wait for me !
OFFICER	Begin retreat !
SECOND OFFICER	Fall back !
VEERS	Distance to power generators ?
PILOT	One - seven , decimal two - eight .
VEERS	Target . Maximum fire power .
HAN	Transport , this is Solo . Better take off -- I   ca n't get to you . I 'll get the princess out on the Falcon .
THREEPIO	But ... but ... but ... where are you going ? Uh ... come back ! !
THREEPIO	Wait ! Wait for me ! Wait ! Stop !
THREEPIO	How typical .
HAN	Come on .
HAN	Hurry up , goldenrod , or you 're going to be a permanent resident !
THREEPIO	Wait ! Wait !
HAN	How 's this ?
LEIA	Would it helped if I got out and pushed ?
HAN	It might .
THREEPIO	Captain Solo , Captain Solo ... sir , might I suggest that   you ...
THREEPIO	It can wait .
LEIA	The bucket of bolts is never going to get us past that blockade .
HAN	This baby 's got a few surprises left in her , sweetheart .
HAN	Come on ! Come on ! Switch over . Let 's hope we do n't have a   burnout .
HAN	See ?
LEIA	Someday you 're going to be wrong , and I hope I 'm there to see it .
HAN	Punch it !
LUKE	Artoo ! Get her ready for takeoff .
WEDGE	Good luck , Luke . See you at the rendezvous .
LUKE	Do n't worry , Artoo . We 're going , we 're going .
LUKE	There 's nothing wrong , Artoo . I 'm just setting a   new course .
LUKE	We 're not going to regroup with the others .
LUKE	We 're going to the Dagobah system .
LUKE	Yes , Artoo ?
LUKE	That 's all right . I 'd like to keep it   on manual control for a while .
HAN	I saw them ! I saw them !
LEIA	Saw what ?
HAN	Star Destroyers , two of them , coming right at us .
THREEPIO	Sir , sir ! Might I suggest ...
HAN	Shut him up or shut him down !   Check the   deflector shield !
HAN	Oh , great . Well , we can still outmaneuver them .
IMPERIAL OFFICER	Take evasive action !
HAN	Prepare to make the jump to light - speed .
THREEPIO	But , sir !
LEIA	They 're getting closer !
HAN	Oh yeah ? Watch this .
LEIA	Watch what ?
HAN	I think we 're in trouble .
THREEPIO	If I may say so , sir , I noticed earlier the hyperdrive   motivator has been damaged . It 's impossible to go to light - speed !
HAN	We 're in trouble !
HAN	Horizontal boosters ... !
HAN	Alluvial dampers ... ! Well that 's not it .
HAN	Bring me the hydrospanners !
HAN	I do n't know how we 're going to get out of this one .
HAN	Oww ! Chewie !
HAN	That was no laser blast ! Something hit us .
LEIA	Han , get up here !
HAN	Come on , Chewie !
LEIA	Asteroids !
HAN	Oh , no ! Chewie , set two - seven - one .
LEIA	What are you doing ? You 're not actually going into an asteroid   field ?
HAN	They 'd be crazy to follow us , would n't they ?
LEIA	You do n't have to do this to impress me .
THREEPIO	Sir , the possibility of successfully navigating an asteroid   field is approximately three thousand , seven hundred and twenty to one .
HAN	Never tell me the odds !
HAN	You said you wanted to be around when I made a mistake ; well ,   this could be it , sweetheart .
LEIA	I take it back . We 're going to get pulverized if we stay out   here much longer .
HAN	I 'm not going to argue with that .
THREEPIO	Pulverized ?
HAN	I 'm going in closer to one of the big ones .
LEIA	Closer ?
THREEPIO	Closer ? !
THREEPIO	Oh , this is suicide !
HAN	There . That looks pretty good .
LEIA	What looks pretty good ?
HAN	Yeah . That 'll do nicely .
THREEPIO	Excuse me , ma'am , but where are we going ?
LEIA	I hope you know what you 're doing .
HAN	Yeah , me too .
LUKE	Yes , that 's it . Dagobah .
LUKE	No , I 'm not going to change my mind about this .    I 'm not picking up any cities or technology . Massive life - form readings , though . There 's something alive down there ...
LUKE	Yes , I 'm sure it 's perfectly safe for droids .
LUKE	I know , I know ! All the scopes are dead . I ca n't   see a thing ! Just hang on , I 'm going to start the landing cycle ...
LUKE	No , Artoo , you stay put . I 'll have a look around .
LUKE	Artoo ?
LUKE	Artoo ! Where are you ?
LUKE	Artoo ! You be more careful .
LUKE	Artoo -- that way !
LUKE	Artoo !
LUKE	Oh , no ! Are you all right ? Come on . You 're lucky you do n't taste   very good . Anything broken ?
LUKE	If you 're saying coming here was a bad idea , I 'm beginning to   agree with you . Oh , Artoo , what are we doing here ? It 's like ... something out of a dream , or , I do n't know . Maybe I 'm just going crazy .
VADER	Yes , Admiral ?
PIETT	Our ships have sighted the Millennium Falcon , lord . But ... it   has entered an asteroid field and we can not risk ...
VADER	Asteroids do not concern me , Admiral . I want   that ship and not excuses .
PIETT	Yes , lord .
HAN	I 'm going to shut down everything but the emergency power   systems .
THREEPIO	Sir , I 'm almost afraid to ask , but ... does that include   shutting me down , too ?
HAN	No , I need you to talk to the Falcon , find out what 's wrong with   the hyperdrive .
THREEPIO	Sir , it 's quite possible this asteroid is not entirely   stable .
HAN	Not entirely stable ? I 'm glad you 're here to tell us these   things .   Chewie , take the professor in the back and plug him into the hyperdrive .
THREEPIO	Oh ! Sometimes I just do n't understand human behavior . After   all , I 'm only trying to do my job in the most ...
LEIA	Let go .
HAN	Sshh !
LEIA	Let go , please .
HAN	Do n't get excited .
LEIA	Captain , being held by you is n't quite enough to get me excited .
HAN	Sorry , sweetheart . We have n't got time for anything else .
LUKE	Ready for some power ? Okay . Let 's see now . Put that in there .   There you go .
LUKE	Now all I have to do is find this Yoda ... if he even   exists .
LUKE	Still ... there 's something familiar about this place . I feel   like ... I do n't know ...
STRANGE VOICE	Feel like what ?
LUKE	Like we 're being watched !
CREATURE	Away with your weapon ! I mean you no harm .
CREATURE	I am wondering , why are you here ?
LUKE	I 'm looking for someone .
CREATURE	Looking ? Found someone , you have , I would say , hmmm ?
LUKE	Right .
CREATURE	Help you I can . Yes , mmmm .
LUKE	I do n't think so . I 'm looking for a great warrior .
CREATURE	Ahhh ! A great warrior .   Wars not   make one great .
LUKE	Put that down . Hey ! That 's my dinner .
CREATURE	How you get so big , eating food of this kind ?
LUKE	Listen , friend , we did n't mean to land in that puddle , and if we   could get our ship out , we would , but we ca n't , so why do n't you just ...
CREATURE	Aww , can not get your ship out ?
LUKE	Hey , you could have broken this . Do n't do that . Ohhh ... you're   making a mess . Hey , give me that !
CREATURE	Mine ! Or I will help you not .
LUKE	I do n't want your help . I want my lamp back . I 'll need it to get   out of this slimy mudhole .
CREATURE	Mudhole ? Slimy ? My home this is .
CREATURE	Ah , ah , ah !
LUKE	Oh , Artoo , let him have it .
CREATURE	Mine ! Mine !
LUKE	Artoo !
CREATURE	Mine !
CREATURE	Mine !
LUKE	Now will you move along , little fella ? We 're got a lot   of work to do .
CREATURE	No ! No , no ! Stay and help you , I will .   Find your   friend , hmm ?
LUKE	I 'm not looking for a friend , I 'm looking for a Jedi Master .
CREATURE	Oohhh . Jedi Master . Yoda . You seek Yoda .
LUKE	You know him ?
CREATURE	Mmm . Take you to him , I will .   Yes , yes . But now , we   must eat . Come . Good food . Come .
CREATURE	Come , come .
LUKE	Stay here and watch after the camp , Artoo .
THREEPIO	Oh , where is Artoo when I need him ?
THREEPIO	Sir , I do n't know where your ship learned to communicate ,   but it has the most peculiar dialect . I believe , sir , it says that the power coupling on the negative axis has been polarized . I 'm afraid you 'll have to replace it .
HAN	Well , of course I 'll have to replace it .
HAN	Here ! And Chewie ...
HAN	... I think we 'd better replace the negative power   coupling .
HAN	Hey , Your Worship , I 'm only trying to help .
LEIA	Would you please stop calling me that ?
HAN	Sure , Leia .
LEIA	Oh , you make it so difficult sometimes .
HAN	I do , I really do . You could be a little nicer , though .   Come on , admit it . Sometimes you think I 'm all right .
LEIA	Occasionally   maybe ... when you are n't   acting like a scoundrel .
HAN	Scoundrel ? Scoundrel ? I like the sound of that .
LEIA	Stop that .
HAN	Stop what ?
LEIA	Stop that ! My hands are dirty .
HAN	My hands are dirty , too . What are you afraid of ?
LEIA	Afraid ?
HAN	You 're trembling .
LEIA	I 'm not trembling .
HAN	You like me because I 'm a scoundrel . There are n't enough   scoundrels in your life .
LEIA	I happen to like nice men .
HAN	I 'm a nice man .
LEIA	No , you 're not . You 're ...
THREEPIO	Sir , sir ! I 've isolated the reverse power flux coupling .
HAN	Thank you . Thank you very much .
THREEPIO	Oh , you 're perfectly welcome , sir .
NEEDA	... and that , Lord Vader , was the last time they   appeared in any of our scopes . Considering the amount of damage we 've sustained , they must have been destroyed .
VADER	No , Captain , they 're alive . I want every ship available to   sweep the asteroid field until they are found .
PIETT	Lord Vader .
VADER	Yes , Admiral , what is it ?
PIETT	The Emperor commands you make contact with him .
VADER	Move the ship out of the asteroid field so that we can send a   clear transmission .
PIETT	Yes , my lord .
VADER	What is thy bidding , my master ?
EMPEROR	There is a great disturbance in the Force .
VADER	I have felt it .
EMPEROR	We have a new enemy -- Luke Skywalker .
VADER	Yes , my master .
EMPEROR	He could destroy us .
VADER	He 's just a boy . Obi - Wan can no longer help him .
EMPEROR	The Force is strong with him . The son of Skywalker must not   become a Jedi .
VADER	If he could be turned , he would become a powerful ally .
EMPEROR	Yes . Yes . He would be a great asset . Can it be done ?
VADER	He will join us or die , my master .
LUKE	Look , I 'm sure it 's delicious . I just do n't understand why we   ca n't see Yoda now .
CREATURE	Patience ! For the Jedi it is time to eat as well . Eat , eat .   Hot . Good food , hm ? Good , hmm ?
LUKE	How far away is Yoda ? Will it take us long to get there ?
CREATURE	Not far . Yoda not far . Patience . Soon you will be with him .    Rootleaf , I cook . Why wish you become Jedi ? Hm ?
LUKE	Mostly because of my father , I guess .
CREATURE	Ah , your father . Powerful Jedi was he , powerful Jedi , mmm .
LUKE	Oh , come on . How could you know my father ? You   do n't even know who I am .   Oh , I do n't even know what I 'm doing here . We 're wasting our time .
CREATURE	I can not teach him . The boy has no patience .
BEN	He will learn patience .
YODA	Hmmm . Much anger in him , like his father .
BEN	Was I any different when you taught me ?
YODA	Hah . He is not ready .
LUKE	Yoda ! I am ready . I ... Ben ! I can be a Jedi . Ben , tell him I 'm   ready .
YODA	Ready , are you ? What know you of ready ? For eight hundred years   have I trained Jedi . My own counsel will I keep on who is to be trained ! A Jedi must have the deepest commitment , the most serious mind .   This one a long time have I watched . Never his mind on where he was . Hmm ? What he was doing . Hmph . Adventure . Heh ! Excitement . Heh ! A Jedi craves not these things .   You are reckless !
BEN	So was I , if you 'll remember .
YODA	He is too old . Yes , too old to begin the training .
LUKE	But I 've learned so much .
YODA	Will he finished what he begins ?
LUKE	I wo n't fail you -- I 'm not afraid .
YODA	Oh , you will be . You will be .
THREEPIO	Sir , if I may venture an opinion ...
HAN	I 'm not really interested in your opinion , Threepio .
LEIA	There 's something out there .
HAN	Where ?
LEIA	Outside , in the cave .
THREEPIO	There it is . Listen ! Listen !
HAN	I 'm going out there .
LEIA	Are you crazy ? !
HAN	I just got this bucket back together . I 'm not going to let   something tear it apart .
LEIA	Then I 'm going with you .
THREEPIO	I think it might be better if I stay here and guard the   ship .   Oh , no .
LEIA	This ground sure feels strange . It does n't feel like rock at   all .
HAN	There 's an awful lot of moisture in here .
LEIA	I do n't know . I have a bad feeling about this .
HAN	Yeah .
HAN	Watch out !
HAN	Yeah , that 's what I thought . Mynock . Chewie , check the rest of   the ship , make sure there are n't any more attached . They 're chewing on the power cables .
LEIA	Mynocks ?
HAN	Go on inside . We 'll clean them off if there are any more .
THREEPIO	Ohhh ! Go away ! Go away ! Beastly thing . Shoo ! Shoo !
HAN	Wait a minute ...
HAN	All right , Chewie , let 's get out of here !
LEIA	The Empire is still out there . I do n't think it 's wise to ...
HAN	No time to discuss this as a committee .
LEIA	I am not a committee !
LEIA	You ca n't make the jump to light - speed in this asteroid field ...
HAN	Sit down , sweetheart . We 're taking off !
THREEPIO	Look !
HAN	I see it , I see it .
THREEPIO	We 're doomed !
LEIA	The cave is collapsing .
HAN	This is no cave .
LEIA	What ?
YODA	Run ! Yes . A Jedi 's strength flows from the Force . But beware of   the dark side . Anger ... fear ... aggression . The dark side of the Force are they . Easily they flow , quick to join you in a fight . If once you start down the dark path , forever will it dominate your destiny , consume you it will , as it did Obi - Wan 's apprentice .
LUKE	Vader . Is the dark side stronger ?
YODA	No ... no ... no . Quicker , easier , more seductive .
LUKE	But how am I to know the good side from the bad ?
YODA	You will know . When you are calm , at peace . Passive . A Jedi uses   the Force for knowledge and defense , never for attack .
LUKE	But tell me why I ca n't ...
YODA	No , no , there is no why . Nothing more will I   teach you today . Clear your mind of questions . Mmm . Mmmmmm .
LUKE	There 's something not right here .
LUKE	I feel cold , death .
YODA	That place ... is strong with the dark side of the Force . A domain   of evil it is . In you must go .
LUKE	What 's in there ?
YODA	Only what you take with you .
YODA	Your weapons ... you will not need them .
PIETT	Bounty hunters . We do n't need that scum .
FIRST CONTROLLER	Yes , sir .
PIETT	Those Rebels wo n't escape us .
SECOND CONTROLLER	Sir , we have a priority signal from the Star   Destroyer Avenger .
PIETT	Right .
VADER	... there will be a substantial reward for the one who finds   the Millennium Falcon . You are free to use any methods necessary , but I want them alive . No disintegrations .
BOBA FETT	As you wish .
PIETT	Lord Vader ! My lord , we have them .
THREEPIO	Oh , thank goodness we 're coming out of the asteroid field .
HAN	Let 's get out of here . Ready for light - speed ? One ... two ... three !
HAN	It 's not fair !
HAN	The transfer circuits are working . It 's not my fault !
LEIA	No light - speed ?
HAN	It 's not my fault .
THREEPIO	Sir , we just lost the main rear deflector shield . One more   direct hit on the back quarter and we 're done for .
HAN	Turn her around .
HAN	I said turn her around ! I 'm going to put all power in the front   shield .
LEIA	You 're going to attack them ? !
THREEPIO	Sir , the odds of surviving a direct assault on an Imperial   Star Destroyer ...
LEIA	Shut up !
NEEDA	They 're moving to attack position . Shields up !
NEEDA	Track them , . They may come around for another pass .
TRACKING OFFICER	Captain Needa , the ship no longer appears on our   scopes .
NEEDA	They ca n't have disappeared . No ship that small has a cloaking   device .
TRACKING OFFICER	Well , there 's no trace of them , sir .
COMMUNICATIONS OFFICER	Captain , Lord Vader demands an update on the   pursuit .
NEEDA	Get a shuttle ready . I shall assume full   responsibility for losing them , and apologize to Lord Vader . Meanwhile , continue to scan the area .
COMMUNICATIONS OFFICER	Yes , Captain Needa .
YODA	Use the Force . Yes ...
YODA	Now ... the stone . Feel it .
YODA	Concentrate !
LUKE	Oh , no . We 'll never get it out now .
YODA	So certain are you . Always with you it can not be done . Hear you   nothing that I say ?
LUKE	Master , moving stones around is one thing . This is totally   different .
YODA	No ! No different ! Only different in your mind . You must unlearn   what you have learned .
LUKE	All right , I 'll give it a try .
YODA	No ! Try not . Do . Or do not . There is no try .
LUKE	I ca n't . It 's too big .
YODA	Size matters not . Look at me . Judge me by my size , do you ? Hm ?   Mmmm .
YODA	And well you should not . For my ally in the Force . And a   powerful ally it is . Life creates it , makes it grow . It 's energy surrounds us and binds us . Luminous beings are we ...... not this crude matter .   You must feel the Force around you .   Here , between you ... me ... the tree ... the rock ... everywhere ! Yes , even between this land and that ship !
LUKE	You want the impossible .
LUKE	I don't ... I do n't believe it .
YODA	That is why you fail .
VADER	Apology accepted , Captain Needa .
PIETT	Lord Vader , our ships have completed their scan of the area and   found nothing . If the Millennium Falcon went into light - speed , it 'll be on the other side of the galaxy by now .
VADER	Alert all commands . Calculate every possible destination along   their last know trajectory .
PIETT	Yes , my lord . We 'll find them .
VADER	Do n't fail me again , Admiral .
PIETT	Alert all commands . Deploy the fleet .
THREEPIO	Captain Solo , this time you have gone too far .   No , I will not be quiet , Chewbacca . Why does n't anyone listen to me ?
HAN	The fleet is beginning to break up . Go back and stand   by the manual release for the landing claw .
THREEPIO	I really do n't see how that s going to help . Surrender is a   perfectly acceptable alternative in extreme circumstances . The Empire may be gracious enough ...
HAN	Thank you .
LEIA	What did you have in mind for your next move ?
HAN	Well , if they follow standard Imperial procedure , they 'll dump   their garbage before they go to light - speed , then we just float away .
LEIA	With the rest of the garbage . Then what ?
HAN	Then we 've got to find a safe port somewhere around here . Got any   ideas ?
LEIA	No . Where are we ?
HAN	The Anoat system .
LEIA	Anoat system . There 's not much there .
HAN	No . Well , wait . This is interesting . Lando .
LEIA	Lando system ?
HAN	Lando 's not a system , he 's a man . Lando Calrissian . He 's a card   player , gambler , scoundrel . You 'd like him .
LEIA	Thanks .
HAN	Bespin . It 's pretty far , but I think we can make it .
LEIA	A mining colony ?
HAN	Yeah , a Tibanna gas mine . Lando conned somebody out of it . We go   back a long way , Lando and me .
LEIA	Can you trust him ?
HAN	No . But he has no love for the Empire , I can tell you that .
HAN	Here we go , Chewie . Stand by . Detach !
LEIA	You do have your moments . Not many , but you have them .
YODA	Concentrate ... feel the Force flow . Yes . Good . Calm , yes . Through   the Force , things you will see . Other places . The future ... the past . Old friends long gone .
LUKE	Han ! Leia !
YODA	Hmm . Control , control . You must learn control .
LUKE	I saw ... I saw a city in the clouds .
YODA	Mmm . Friends you have there .
LUKE	They were in pain .
YODA	It is the future you see .
LUKE	Future ? Will they die ?
YODA	Difficult to see . Always in motion is the future .
LUKE	I 've got to go to them .
YODA	Decide you must how to serve them best . If you leave now , help   them you could . But you would destroy all for which they have fought and suffered .
HAN	No , I do n't have a landing permit . I 'm trying   to reach Lando Calrissian .
HAN	Whoa ! Wait a minute ! Let me explain .
INTERCOM VOICE	You will not deviate from your present course .
THREEPIO	Rather touchy , are n't they ?
LEIA	I thought you knew this person .
HAN	Well , that was a long time ago . I 'm sure he 's   forgotten about that .
INTERCOM VOICE	Permission granted to land on Platform   Three - two - seven .
HAN	Thank you .
HAN	There 's nothing to worry about . We go way back , Lando and me .
LEIA	Who 's worried ?
THREEPIO	Oh . No one to meet us .
LEIA	I do n't like this .
HAN	Well , what would you like ?
THREEPIO	Well , they did let us land .
HAN	Look , do n't worry . Everything 's going to be fine . Trust me .
HAN	See ? My friend .   Keep your eyes open , okay ?
LANDO	Why , you slimy , double - crossing , no - good swindler ! You 've got a   lot of guts coming here , after what you pulled .
LANDO	How you doing , you old pirate ? So good to see you ! I   never thought I 'd catch up with you again . Where you been ?
THREEPIO	Well , he seems very friendly .
LEIA	Yes ... very friendly .
LANDO	What are you doing here ?
HAN	Ahh ... repairs . I thought you could   help me out .
LANDO	What have you done to my ship ?
HAN	Your ship ? Hey , remember , you lost her to me fair and square .
LANDO	Hello . What have we here ? Welcome . I 'm Lando Calrissian . I 'm   the administrator of this facility . and who might you be ?
LEIA	Leia .
LANDO	Welcome , Leia .
HAN	All right , all right , you old smoothie .
THREEPIO	Hello , sir . I am See - Threepio , human - cyborg relations . My   facilities are at your ...
THREEPIO	Well , really !
LANDO	What 's wrong with the Falcon ?
HAN	Hyperdrive .
LANDO	I 'll get my people to work on it .
HAN	Good .
LANDO	You know , that ship saved my life quite a few times . She 's the   fastest hunk of junk in the galaxy .
HAN	How 's the gas mine ? Is it paying off for you ?
LANDO	Oh , not as well as I 'd like . We 're a small outpost and not very   self - sufficient . And I 've had supply problems of every kind . I 've had labor difficulties ... What 's so funny ?
HAN	You . Listen to you -- you sound like a businessman , a responsible   leader . Who 'd have thought that , huh ?
LANDO	You know , seeing you sure brings back a few things .
HAN	Yeah .
LANDO	Yeah , I 'm responsible these days . It 's the   price you pay for being successful .
THREEPIO	Oh ! Nice to see a familiar face .
SECOND THREEPIO	E chu ta !
THREEPIO	How rude !
THREEPIO	That sounds like an R2 unit in there . I wonder if ...
THREEPIO	Hello ? How interesting . Oh , my .
MAN	Who are you ?
THREEPIO	Oh , I 'm terribly sorry . I ... I did n't mean to intrude . No ,   no , please do n't get up . No !
YODA	Luke ! You must complete the training .
LUKE	I ca n't keep the vision out of my head . They 're my friends . I 've   got to help them .
YODA	You must not go !
LUKE	But Han and Leia will die if I do n't .
BEN	You do n't know that .
BEN	Even Yoda can not see their fate .
LUKE	But I can help them ! I feel the Force !
BEN	But you can not control it . This is a dangerous time for you , when   you will be tempted by the dark side of the Force .
YODA	Yes , yes . To Obi - Wan you listen . The cave . Remember your failure   at the cave !
LUKE	But I 've learned so much since then . Master Yoda , I promise to   return and finish what I 've begun . You have my word .
BEN	It is you and your abilities the Emperor wants . that is why your   friends are made to suffer .
LUKE	And that is why I have to go .
BEN	Luke , I do n't want to lose you to the Emperor the way I lost   Vader .
LUKE	You wo n't .
YODA	Stopped they must be . On this depends . Only a fully trained Jedi   Knight with the Force as his ally will conquer Vader and his Emperor . If you end your training now , if you choose the quick and easy path , as Vader did , you will become an agent of evil .
BEN	Patience .
LUKE	And sacrifice Han and Leia ?
YODA	If you honor what they fight for ... yes !
BEN	If you choose to face Vader , you will do it alone . I can not   interfere .
LUKE	I understand .   Artoo , fire up the   converters .
BEN	Luke , do n't give in to hate -- that leads to the dark side .
YODA	Strong is Vader . Mind what you have learned . Save you it can .
LUKE	I will . And I 'll return . I promise .
YODA	Told you , I did . Reckless is he . Now matters are worse .
BEN	That boy is our last hope .
YODA	No . There is another .
HAN	The ship is almost finished . Two or Three more things and we 're   in great shape .
LEIA	The sooner the better . Something 's wrong here . No one has seen   or knows anything about Threepio . He 's been gone too long to have gotten lost .
HAN	Relax . I 'll talk to Lando and see what I can find out .
LEIA	I do n't trust Lando .
HAN	Well , I do n't trust him , either . But he is my friend . Besides ,   we 'll soon be gone .
LEIA	And then you 're as good as gone , are n't you ?
LEIA	What happened ?
HAN	Where ? Found him in a junk pile ?
LEIA	Oh , what a mess . Chewie , do you think you can repair him ?
HAN	Lando 's got people who can fix him .
LEIA	No , thanks .
LANDO	I 'm sorry . Am I interrupting anything ?
LEIA	Not really .
LANDO	You look absolutely beautiful . You truly belong here with us   among the clouds .
LEIA	Thank you .
LANDO	Will you join me for a little refreshment ?
LANDO	Everyone 's invited , of course .
LANDO	Having trouble with you droid ?
HAN	No . No problem . Why ?
LANDO	So you see , since we 're a small operation , we do n't fall into   the ... uh ... jurisdiction of the Empire .
LEIA	So you 're part of the mining guild then ?
LANDO	No , not actually . Our operation is small enough not to be   noticed ... which is advantageous for everybody since our customers are anxious to avoid attracting attention to themselves .
HAN	Are n't you afraid the Empire 's going to find out about this   little operation and shut you down ?
LANDO	That 's always been a danger looming like a shadow over   everything we 've built here . But things have developed that will insure security . I 've just made a deal that will keep the Empire out of here forever .
VADER	We would be honored if you would join us .
LANDO	I had no choice . They arrived right before you did . I 'm sorry .
HAN	I 'm sorry , too .
LUKE	No , Threepio 's with them .
LUKE	Just hang on . We 're almost there .
THREEPIO	Mmmm . Oh , my . Uh , I , uh -- Take this off ! I , uh , do n't mean   to intrude here . I , do n't , no , no , no ... Please do n't get up . No !
THREEPIO	Stormtroopers ? Here ? We 're in danger . I must tell the   others . Oh , no ! I 've been shot !
LANDO	Lord Vader .
VADER	You may take Captain Solo to Jabba the Hut after I   have Skywalker .
BOBA FETT	He 's no good to me dead .
VADER	He will not be permanently damaged .
LANDO	Lord Vader , what about Leia and the Wookiee ?
VADER	They must never again leave this city .
LANDO	That was never a condition of our agreement , nor was giving Han   to this bounty hunter !
VADER	Perhaps you think you 're being treated unfairly .
LANDO	No .
VADER	Good . It would be unfortunate if I had to leave a garrison   here .
LANDO	This deal 's getting worse all the time .
THREEPIO	Oh , yes , that 's very good . I like that . Oh ! Something 's not   right because now I ca n't see . Wait . Wait ! Oh , my ! what have you done ? I 'm backwards , you stupid furball . Only an overgrown mophead like you would be stupid enough ...
HAN	I feel terrible .
LEIA	Why are they doing this ?
HAN	They never even asked me any questions .
LEIA	Lando .
HAN	Get out of here , Lando !
LANDO	Shut up and listen ! Vader has agreed to turn Leia and Chewie   over to me .
HAN	Over to you ?
LANDO	They 'll have to stay here , but at least they 'll be safe .
LEIA	What about Han ?
LANDO	Vader 's giving him to the bounty hunter .
LEIA	Vader wants us all dead .
LANDO	He does n't want you at all . He 's after somebody called   Skywalker .
HAN	Luke ?
LANDO	Lord Vader has set a trap for him .
LEIA	And we 're the bait .
LANDO	Well , he 's on his way .
HAN	Perfect . You fixed us all pretty good , did n't you ?    My friend !
LANDO	Stop ! I 've done all I can do . I 'm sorry I could n't do better ,   but I have my own problems .
HAN	Yeah , you 're a real hero .
LEIA	You certainly have a way with people .
VADER	This facility is crude , but it should be adequate to freeze   Skywalker for his journey to the Emperor .
IMPERIAL SOLDIER	Lord Vader , ship approaching . X - wing class .
VADER	Good . Monitor Skywalker and allow him to land .
LANDO	Lord Vader , we only use this facility for carbon freezing . If   you put him in there , it might kill him .
VADER	I do not want the Emperor 's prize damaged . We will test it ... on   Captain Solo .
THREEPIO	If only you had attached my legs , I would n't be in this   ridiculous position . Now , remember , Chewbacca , you have a responsibility to me , so do n't do anything foolish .
HAN	What 's going on ... buddy ?
LANDO	You 're being put into carbon freeze .
BOBA FETT	What if he does n't survive ? He 's worth a lot to me .
VADER	The Empire will compensate you if he dies . Put him in !
THREEPIO	Oh , no ! No , no , no ! Stop , Chewbacca , stop ... !
HAN	Stop , Chewie , stop ! Do you hear me ? Stop !
THREEPIO	Yes , stop , please ! I 'm not ready to die .
HAN	Chewie ! Chewie , this wo n't help me . Hey !
HAN	Save your strength . There 'll be another time . The princess -- you   have to take care of her . You hear me ?
LEIA	I love you !
HAN	I know .
THREEPIO	What ... what 's going on ? Turn around , Chewbacca , I ca n't see .   Oh ... they've encased him in carbonite . He should be quite well - protected -- if he survives the freezing process , that is .
VADER	Well , Calrissian , did he survive ?
LANDO	Yes , he 's alive . And in perfect hibernation .
VADER	He 's all yours bounty hunter . Reset the chamber for Skywalker .
IMPERIAL OFFICER	Skywalker has just landed , my lord .
VADER	Good . See to it that he finds his way here . Calrissian , take   the princess and the Wookiee to my ship .
LANDO	You said they 'd be left in the city under my supervision .
VADER	I am altering the deal . Pray I do n't alter it any further .
LEIA	Luke ! Luke , do n't -- it 's a trap ! It 's a trap !
VADER	The Force is with you , young Skywalker . But you are not a Jedi   yet .
LANDO	Well done . Hold them in the security tower -- and keep it   quiet . Move .
LEIA	What do you think you 're doing ?
LANDO	We 're getting out of here .
THREEPIO	I knew all along it had to be a mistake .
LEIA	Do you think that after what you did to Han we 're going to trust   you ?
LANDO	I had no choice ...
THREEPIO	What are you doing ? Trust him , trust him !
LEIA	Oh , so we understand , do n't we , Chewie ? He had no choice .
LANDO	I 'm just trying to help ...
LEIA	We do n't need any of your help .
LANDO	H - a - a - a ...
LEIA	What ?
THREEPIO	It sounds like Han .
LANDO	There 's still a chance to save Han ... I mean , at the East   Platform ...
LEIA	Chewie .
THREEPIO	I 'm terribly sorry about all this . After all ,   he 's only a Wookiee .
BOBA FETT	Put Captain Solo in the cargo hold .
THREEPIO	Artoo ! Artoo ! Where have you been ?
THREEPIO	Turn around , you wooly ... !   Hurry , hurry ! We 're   trying to save Han from the bounty hunter !
THREEPIO	Well , at least your still in one piece ! Look what happened   to me !
THREEPIO	Oh , no ! Chewie , they 're behind you !
VADER	You have learned much , young one .
LUKE	You 'll find I 'm full of surprises .
VADER	Your destiny lies with me , Skywalker . Obi - Wan knew this to be   true .
LUKE	No !
VADER	All to easy . Perhaps you are not as strong as the Emperor   thought .
VADER	Impressive ... most impressive .
VADER	Obi - Wan has taught you well . You have controlled your fear ...   now release your anger .
VADER	Only your hatred can destroy me .
LANDO	The security codes has been changed !
THREEPIO	Artoo , you can tell the computer to override the security   system .
LANDO	Attention ! This is Lando Calrissian . The Empire has takes   control of the city . I advise everyone to leave before more Imperial troops arrive .
LANDO	This way .
THREEPIO	Do n't blame me . I 'm an interpreter . I 'm not supposed to know   a power socket from a computer terminal .
THREEPIO	What are you talking about ? We 're not interested in the   hyperdrive on the Millennium Falcon . It 's fixed ! Just open the door , you stupid lump .
THREEPIO	I never doubted you for a second . Wonderful !
THREEPIO	Ouch ! Oh ! Ah ! That hurt , Bend down , you thoughtless ... Ow !
LANDO	Leia ! Go !
THREEPIO	I thought that hairy beast would be the end of me . Of   course , I 've looked better .
VADER	You are beaten . It is useless to resist . Do n't let yourself be   destroyed as Obi - Wan did .
VADER	There is no escape . Do n't make me destroy you . You do not yet   realize your importance . You have only begun to discover you power . Join me and I will complete your training . With our combined strength , we can end this destructive conflict and bring order to the galaxy .
LUKE	I 'll never join you !
VADER	If you only knew the power of the dark side . Obi - Wan never told   you what happened to your father .
LUKE	He told me enough ! He told me you killed him .
VADER	No . I am your father .
LUKE	No . No . That 's not true ! That 's impossible !
VADER	Search your feelings . You know it to be true .
LUKE	No ! No ! No !
VADER	Luke . You can destroy the Emperor . He has foreseen this . It is   your destiny . Join me , and we can rule the galaxy as father and son . Come with me . It 's the only way .
LUKE	Ben ... Ben , please !
LUKE	Ben . Leia !
LUKE	Hear me ! Leia !
LEIA	Luke ... We've got to go back .
LANDO	What ?
LEIA	I know where Luke is .
LANDO	But what about those fighter ?
LEIA	Chewie , just do it .
LANDO	But what about Vader ?
LANDO	All right , all right , all right .
VADER	Bring my shuttle .
LANDO	Look , someone 's up there .
LEIA	It 's Luke . Chewie , slow down . Slow down and we 'll get under him .   Lando , open the top hatch .
LEIA	Okay . Easy , Chewie .
LEIA	Lando ?
LANDO	Okay , let 's go .
LUKE	Oh , Leia .
LANDO	All right , Chewie . Let 's go .
LEIA	I 'll be back .
LEIA	Star Destroyer .
LANDO	All right , Chewie . Ready for light - speed .
LEIA	If your people fixed the hyperdrive .
LEIA	All the coordinates are set . It 's now or never .
LANDO	Punch it !
LANDO	They told me they fixed it . I trusted them to fix it . It 's not   my fault !
PIETT	They 'll be in range of our tractor beam in moments , lord .
VADER	Did your men deactivate the hyperdrive on the Millennium   Falcon ?
PIETT	Yes , my lord .
VADER	Good . Prepare the boarding party and set for your weapons for   stun .
PIETT	Yes , my lord .
THREEPIO	Noisy brute . Why do n't we just go into light - speed ?
THREEPIO	We ca n't ? How would you know the hyperdrive is deactivated ?
THREEPIO	The city 's central computer told you ? Artoo - Detoo , you know   better than to trust a strange computer . Ouch ! Pay attention to what you 're doing !
VADER	Luke .
LUKE	Father .
VADER	Son , come with me .
LUKE	Ben , why did n't you tell me ?
LANDO	Chewie !
LUKE	It 's Vader .
VADER	Luke ... it is your destiny .
LUKE	Ben , why did n't you tell me ?
PIETT	Alert all commands . Ready for the tractor beam .
THREEPIO	Artoo , come back at once ! You have n't finished with me yet !   You do n't know how to fix the hyperdrive . Chewbacca can do it . I 'm standing here in pieces , and you 're having delusions of grandeur !
THREEPIO	Oh , you did it !
LANDO	Luke , we 're ready for takeoff .
LUKE	Good luck , Lando
LANDO	When we find Jabba the Hut and that bounty   hunter , we 'll contact you .
LUKE	I 'll meet you at the rendezvous point on   Tatooine .
LANDO	Princess , we 'll find Han . I promise .
LUKE	Chewie , I 'll be waiting for your signal .
LUKE	Take care , you two . May the Force be with you .
LUKE	Ow !
